  LockedIn is going to be a top-down escape room comedy game where items are in random positions, serving as either an opstacle, or a tool.
  This game's artwork is a pixelated toony style, to amplify the comedy.
  LockedIn is inspired by the (non)game "There Is No Game".
  in LockedIn, you will be a man trying to find the keys to your front door so you can get to work.
  the challenge in LockedIn is getting around or moving opstacles blocking doorways, or certain items, and using items in dumb ways to do so.   you have a limited inventories, and the opstacles will never go away, they will just move around.
